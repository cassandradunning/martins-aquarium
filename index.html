    <!-- Now, you're ready to see if your fish print to the console. But, first you'll need 
    to tell your browser to load and run your javascript. To do that, add a <script> tag 
        to index.html, right above the closing <body> tag. -->

        <script type="module" src="./scripts/main.js"></script>

        <!-- Designating main.js as type="module" allows you to utilize the import and export 
            syntax. Note that main.js is the only file we need to load via a <script> tag. The 
            import statements will cause a daisy-chain effect of sorts, causing any other 
            imported modules to also be loaded and evaluated by the browser. -->
